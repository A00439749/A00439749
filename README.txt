Hi there, my name is Prashant Bana and I'm currently enrolled in a full-time graduate program (A00439749) at Saint Mary's University, Nova Scotia. I graduated in computer science and technology from SRM University in 2018. During the last semester of my studies, I landed an job as a full stack PHP developer at a used-car startup based out of New Delhi. Later I switched to a more data centric role in order to get a better exposure of the industry. During my tenure as a Data Engineer, i got to work on creation and maintenance of Python based data processing platforms and complex databases.
